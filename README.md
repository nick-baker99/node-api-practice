# Node & Express Practice Project

## Description
Following a youtube learning course on Node JS & Express to build an API with CRUD functionality. Through this tutorial I learnt the basics of Node JS and express and how to integrate with a MongoDB database.

With this knowledge I plan to create the backend for a React application I am currently working on.
